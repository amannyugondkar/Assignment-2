### **Array_and_ArrayList**<br>
## **Description**<br>
This repository contains Java programs that perform various array operations, including separating even and odd numbers, finding the smallest distance between neighboring elements, and converting between arrays and ArrayLists.<br>

## **Files in the Repository** <br>
Main.java: The main entry point of the program that demonstrates the functionalities.<br>
UserInput.java: Handles user input for creating and processing arrays.<br>
ArrayExercise.java: Contains methods to perform various array-related tasks.<br>
## **Features**<br>
Separates Even and Odd Numbers<br>
Declares two arrays, even and odd, and moves user-input numbers into respective arrays based on parity.<br>
Finds Smallest Distance Between Neighboring Numbers<br>
Implements a function to find two neighboring numbers with the smallest distance and returns the index of the first number.<br>
Converts an array to an ArrayList and vice versa.<br>
## **How to Run:**<br>
Compile the program using javac Main.java<br>
Run it using java Main<br>
## **Methods in ArrayExercise.java**<br>
separateEvenOdd(int[] numbers): Accepts an array of integers. Separates numbers into even and odd arrays. Returns a 2D array containing both separated arrays.<br>
findAllSmallestDistancePairs(int[] arr): Finds two neighboring numbers with the smallest distance. Returns the index of the first number.<br>
convertArrayToArrayList(Integer[] arr): Converts an Integer[] array into an ArrayList.<br>
convertArrayListToArray(ArrayList arrayList): Converts an ArrayList back into an Integer[] array.<br>
